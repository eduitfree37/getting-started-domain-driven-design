# Getting Started: Domain-Driven Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a highly effective approach to software development that focuses on creating a domain model with a deep understanding of the processes and rules within a domain. This approach, as articulated by Martin Fowler, promotes aligned collaboration between business stakeholders and developers, resulting in software that accurately addresses business needs. Since its formal establishment by Eric Evans in 2003, DDD has been widely adopted by developers to build software based on a robust design model. In this introductory course, Amichai Mantinband provides practical insights and real-world examples to demystify Domain-Driven Design.
